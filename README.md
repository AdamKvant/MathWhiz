# MathWhiz
MathWhiz is fast-paced (soon to be timed) math testing platform. It is designed to emulate the timed math tests that many students (grades 1-4) have to take at school.

Right now MathWhiz is not timed, and currently will go on forever. I will add these features in a later update.

MathWhiz was created using the `Express.js` framework.

## Changelog
* `1.0` - The most basic version of the webapp is complete.

## MathWhiz TODO list
- add time limit
- number range selections
- sessions (high scores)
- hashing for answers(anticheat)
