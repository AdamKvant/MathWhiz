# MathWhiz
MathWhiz is fast-paced math testing platform. It is designed to emulate the timed math tests that many students (grades 1-4) have to take at school.

Right now MathWhiz is timed, but currently will go on forever. I will add these features in a later update.

You can run MathWhiz by typing `node .\server.js` into the CLI. The site can be accessed at `http://localhost:5678/`.

MathWhiz was created using the `Express.js` framework.

## Changelog
* `1.0` - The most basic version of the webapp is complete.

* `1.0.1` - Game now has a timer (doesn't stop the player yet), subtracts from score for skipped questions, and has some critical bugs fixed.

## MathWhiz TODO list
- add time limit
- number range selections
- sessions (high scores)
- hashing for answers(anticheat)
